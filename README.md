# qdc-cmip6-qaqc
This repository consists of the quality assuarance and control (QAQC) codes for the QDC-scaled CMIP6 products developed for the Australian Climate Service - [code for the data generation of this product can be found here](https://github.com/AusClimateService/qqscale), and [the product is described here](https://github.com/AusClimateService/qq-workflows/blob/main/qdc-cmip6/specs_qdc-cmip6_v1.md).

This QAQC code was written to run on the Gadi supercomputer hosted by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), and thus may have some use some modules specific to python environments hosted on NCI.
As such, it may not be fully portable to other systems, nor may it be be suited for QAQC processes on utilising the same workflow on other data. Please contact the contributors to this package if you have any issues with the code, or have noticed flaws that should be rectified.
